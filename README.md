README

add overall info on what we did here



before running:
use a 7x10 checkerboard pattern in order to cailbrate camera, make sure there is 100% overlap, make sure u try bunch of angles and positions encompassing the whole screen for both cameras. 

to run go to main and select the variables such as left video, right video, timestamp(timestamp between calibration and where u want avatar to start), and finally the resolution percentage.

Also upload your left video and right video files to media

your outputs will show up in the outputs folder with final_result corresponding to the final result, and smartboard_output corresponding to the whiteboard perspective transformation
